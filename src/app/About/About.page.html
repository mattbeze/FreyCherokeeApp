        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <br>
        As per the homepage, this application is designed to help beginners learn Spanish in a contextual setting.
        This project has been brought to light by Doctor Ben Frey at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
        It serves as a prototype for a future application that may be in Cherokee to help people learn languages in contextual settings as an alternative to classroom learning.
        The prototype is in Spanish.  
        <br>
        <br>
        In turn, we decided to use ordering coffee at the local on-campus coffee shop for contextual learning.
        Students that use this application will be able to watch an example video, draw vocabulary, and insert their own vocabulary to order a coffee in Spanish.
        This idea of contextual learning is intended to be used in other scenarios in the future.
